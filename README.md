# Overview

## What is Python?

#### • Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
#### • The compiler converts your entire code into machine code and stores it as an executable format file.
#### • Interpreter translates one line of code at a time into machine code then executes it before converting the next line of source code.
#### • Python was created by 'Guido van Rossum' & was released in 1991.

## Advantages of Python 

### 1) Easy to Read, Learn and Write
####     • Python’s syntax is simple. It’s much like writing in English, and this is why it is easy to read (and understand) and write code in Python.
####    • Python code is concise. Unlike Java, you can get things done in less lines of code.

### 2) Improved Productivity
####     • Python is a very productive language.  Due to the simplicity of Python, developers can focus on solving the problem.
####     • They don’t need to spend too much time in understanding the syntax or behavior of the programming language.
####     • You write less code and get more things done.

### 3) Interpreted Language
####     • Python is an interpreted language which means that Python directly executes the code line by line.
####     • In case of any error, it stops further execution and reports back the error which has occurred.
####     • Python shows only one error even if the program has multiple errors. This makes debugging easier.

### 4) Dynamically Typed
####     • Python doesn’t know the type of variable until we run the code.
####     • It automatically assigns the data type during execution.
####     • The programmer doesn’t need to worry about declaring variables and their data types.

### 5)  Object-Oriented
####     • Python is an object-oriented language and also supports functional programming. It can model the real world.
####     • Python supports both object-oriented programming and procedure-oriented programming. And it also supports multiple inheritances (Java doesn’t).

### 6) Free and Open-Source
####     • Python comes under the OSI approved open-source license. This makes it free to use and distribute.
####     • You can download the source code, modify it and even distribute your version of Python.
####     • This is useful for organizations that want to modify some specific behavior and use their version for development.

## In which domains Python is used?
####     • Python is everywhere. There is nothing you can’t do with it.

• Data Science &emsp; • Machine Learning &emsp; • Artificial Intelligence &emsp; • GUI and Game development
• Web development &emsp; • Computer Vision (CV)/ Image manipulation &emsp; • Robotics
• Web Scraping &emsp; • Network Programming &emsp; • Numeric and Scientific Computing
